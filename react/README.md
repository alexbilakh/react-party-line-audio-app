# Party line: An audio-only demo for React

## Built by and with [Daily](https://docs.daily.co/docs/reference-docs)

---

This app is built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run locally:

- Clone this repo locally
- Run the following

```terminal
npm i
npm run start
```

## Testing

To add more participants to your call, you can run additional windows locally or take advantage of the React demo currently hosted at [partyline.daily.co](https://partyline.daily.co/).

## Deployment

Once you've deployed your own server, make sure to update the necessary URLs as noted in:

- react/src/CallProvider.jsx

## A note for Safari users

Safari prevents the auto playing of audio by default. You can enable this in Preferences > Websites > Auto-Play
